The year is half over. 

Because at the beginning of they year I had promised myself that I'll read more and documented that in this (post)[https://krtkush.github.io/2018/02/22/bookshelf.html], this is a followup of what all I have read till now. 

Books - 
1. Delhi: A novel
2. The modern architecture of New Delhi
3. Train to Pakistan
4. Maximum City: Bombay Lost & Found 


Audio books -
This was for the first time I listened to Audio books. I was always sceptical about what the experience would be like; the thought of listening to someone recite a book was quite unappealing. But after about a month of listening to them, I'm hooked. They're excellent while commuting, running or doing any task that does not require much brain power. As a bonus, they're quicker to finish too. 

1. The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of The Ring
2. Harry Potter and the The Philosopher's Stone
3. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
4. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban


Currently reading -
1. City of Djinns: A Year in Delhi
2. Bauhaus
