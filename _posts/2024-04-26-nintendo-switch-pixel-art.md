<div style="text-align: center">
    <img alt="A pixel art of Nintendo Switch Joy cons in the iconic blue and red colors." 
        height="102" width="200" src="/assets/images/pixel-art/Switch.png" title="Switch" />
</div>

The Nintendo Switch.

It is such a childhood dream come true gadget for me. Introduced 7 years back but continues to deliver to this day. 
This was pretty easy to make since I had already made the [Joy-Cons]({{ site.url }}/pixel-art-joy-cons/).

Made with Aseprite.
Original size - 120x62 pixels (As seen on the header - top right). The one below has been scaled up to 200x102 pixels.

_Note: The header will always feature my latest Pixel art attempt._
