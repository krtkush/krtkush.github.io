For about half a decade I have had the intention to read the book _Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software 
by Charles Petzold_. I read the first few chapters a couple of years back and found it really engrossing and true to its hype. 
A lot of concepts just _clicked_ like never before. So, I finally bought the book recently and with 12 chapters into it, 
I regret the delay. It is such a well-written and explained book; a must-read for anyone who wishes 
to learn about how computers work and why they behave like they do. So many of those aforementioned _clicks_!

This book and some similar ones have inspired me to compile a self-study course for myself (and maybe others) to
understand computers from the ground up. While I have studied Computer Science formerly at school and university, 
I think a lot of concepts need to be revisited or studied deeper simply because I never touched those topics 
beyond the classroom. Additionally, I think I would appreciate the knowledge more now. Learning from the first principles 
is a very compelling idea to become a better programmer and understand the world in more details.   

So, here is a draft of what I have in my mind:

1. **Foundation/ First Principle topics:** Read the book _Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software_
2. **Interactive and Fun:** Play the game _Turing Complete_
3. **Hands on course:** Read the book _The Elements of Computer Systems_ and parallelly take the companion course _Nand2Tetris_
4. **Supplementary material:** Watch the _Crash Course Computer Science_ playlist on YouTube.
5. **Followup materials:** 
   6. Book: _But How Do It Know?_
   7. DIY Project: _Warren's Crazy Small CPU_

While this is a draft, I think it lays a good foundation for me to start exploring. 
The approach of this bootcamp is in the order of _Theory_ -> _Play_ -> _Build_ -> _Reflect_ -> _Expand_. 
I am tempted to include history books like, _The Dream Machine by M. Mitchell Waldrop_, to provide context 
or to glue everything together. But I am not completely sold on it yet. The _Crash Course Computer Science_ playlist 
already kind of does it in a more laid-back manner. 

As I progress through the content mentioned above, I'll update the bootcamp approach with subsequent posts.
