This Easter weekend, my wife and I visited Hamburg. This was the first time we headed to the north of Germany. I really 
wanted to make use of my iPhone 15 Pro's camera, and it was not too difficult to do that thanks to spring and 
how photogenic the city is.  

<h3>Day 1 and 2</h3>

Day 1 was mostly about traveling to Hamburg from my City. It was a 5-hour uncomfortable ride because, it seemed, 
pretty much the whole of Germany was traveling. Unfortunately, we did not have a reserved seat, so we had alternate
between standing and sitting on the train floor.

The next day was gray, cloudy and wet. However, we went to [Nord Coast Coffee Roastery](https://www.nordcoast-coffee.shop/) for a delicious 
and really well presented brunch. From there we walked through the old part of the city. The [elevated walkways](https://urbangreenbluegrids.com/measures/measures-at-the-town-or-city-level/raised-evacuation-routes-and-paths/)
along the old red building were fun to navigate and use. Next, we took a ferry to Finkenwerder and back. It was amusing
to observe the port cranes and vehicles function like clockwork from distance. Finally, we ended the day with some 
neapolitan pizza at [Spaccaforno](https://spaccaforno.de/) before heading back to our hotel.

<h3>Day 3</h3>

The next day started gray again, but it became bright and sunny by noon. We began with a delicious brunch at [Beans & Buns](https://beansnbuns.de/) 
and then headed to [Chocoversum](https://www.chocoversum.de/en/home/) for a fun hands-on tour where we prepared our own bars of chocolate.
After that we headed to the Planten un Blomen park, which was bustling with people out to enjoy the warm spring sun. The park has been added into my list of places 
I would love to go for a run. We basked in the sun for a few hours and observed all the diverse people.

Later in the evening, we headed to [Momo Ramen](https://www.momo-ramen.de) for one of the most comforting ramen I have ever had.

Next day we headed back home and thankfully managed to get a seat to sit on the train. 
I will definitely return to Hamburg again in the future and explore all the places I could not.
