Last year I bought the Steam Deck OLED which unfortunately resulted in the Switch sitting on the shelf, collecting dust.

The first impression when I unboxed the device wasâ€”"This is huge!" But within a day I realized how much
of a well-designed machine it is. I have played countless hours on it until now, and I don't think that is changing anytime soon.

Made with Aseprite.

Original size - 160x92 pixels.
