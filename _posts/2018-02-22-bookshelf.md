2017 was the most disappointing year for me with respect to reading books. I failed to complete a single book. Through the year I only, occasionally, read one book - Metamaus by Art Spiegelman and still could not complete it. 

Anyhow, this year I have decided to read more. 

The first book I picked up was Delhi by Khushwant Singh. There were numerous reasons behind it. 

First, I recently started religiously reading a blog called 'The Delhi Walla'. This brilliant piece of ongoing work hooked me and made me a lot more curious about Delhi - my home for 25 years. 

Second, being a big fan of the architecture of central Delhi, Sujan Singh Park piqued my interest and I soon found that Mr. Singh himself used to reside there (and the flats were built by his grand father). Why I went looking for Sujan Singh Park I cannot recall but I'm sure it was because of the above mentioned blog.

Third, I was moving out of Delhi (Gurgaon actually. I had moved out of Delhi way back in 2013) and wanted to dig deeper into the rich history of the city.

Fourth, years back, while waiting for someone at a mall, I had wandered into a bookshop and picked up this very book to read. I read a couple of pages and forced myself to put down the book because I knew I won't be able to devour the whole book at that moment. 

Therefore, it was natural for me to choose Delhi as my first book of the year and the first read of Khushwant Singh's work.
