On reading the article [Replacing Disqus with Github Comments](http://donw.io/post/github-comments/) I found it down right apalling that Disqus collects so much data and let's so many services (some quite shady) track its users. 

Disqus on my blog has been a really good add-on in terms of functionality. I was pretty happy with it - well, until now. I intend to replace it with a less intrusive service; which I have yet to figure out. This and I will probably have to figure out a way to preserve the comments that are already there on my posts.
