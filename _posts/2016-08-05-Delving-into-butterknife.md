Butterknife comes up right on top of my 'Basic Android libraries to use' list whenever I'm setting up a new Android project. It is fairy simple to use and straight forward to implement. It helps me get rid of lot of biolerplate code and makes my code look pretty and easy to understand. I highly reccomend it.

I wanted to share some not so straight forward stuff I learnt about Butterknife while working with it.
