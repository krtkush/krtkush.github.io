NewPipe [v0.13.6](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases/tag/v0.13.6) is out (and then, [v0.13.7](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases/tag/v0.13.7) with a hotfix). 

v0.13.6 came with a bug fix by yours truly. Hence, the announcement on my blog. 

More details about the bug and the fix - [Bug #640](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/640) and [Pull request #1463](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/1463).

This happens to be my first opens source contribution outside my own open source projects and bug reporting! More to follow :)
