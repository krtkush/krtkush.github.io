The Nintendo Switch's iconic Joy-Cons.

I have re-discovered the joy of video games after decades getting my hands on the Switch last year. Therefore, 
I dedicate the first pixel art post of this blog to a pair of unostentatious but astonishingly versatile Joy-Cons!

Made with Aseprite.
Original size - 64x64 pixels (As seen on the header - top right). The one below has been scaled up to 128x128 pixels.

_Note: The header will always feature my latest Pixel art attempt._
