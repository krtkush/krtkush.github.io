I grew up in a privileged household. I had access to a computer even before I could comprehend what it was. 
My parents made sure we had internet at home as soon as it became commercially available in the country. 
And thanks to my mother’s career as a high school computer science teacher, 
I had access to resources which only a few people of my age could in the country at that time. 
Computers were unusually ubiquitous to me for that time in India.

However, despite the easy and abundant access to technology, gaming was not really encouraged in my household. 
It was considered a distraction, a waste of time and an activity which lead to no positive outcomes. 
And then, the computers at home were never good enough to run any latest games. That said, I still played. 
Despite the discouragement, my early memories of computers are mostly about playing games. _Wolf 3D, Dave, Bio Menace,
Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Quake, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Age of Empires_ and _Counter Strike_ are 
some of the ones I fondly remember. Hell, my parents gifted me a knock-off Video Game console for one of my birthdays. 
It was called Polystation[1]! When I hit my teens, Macromedia Flash caught my attention, 
and then most of my time was spent making animations, websites or reading (and trying to maintain my own) blogs.

Eventually, I started reading computer magazines like _Digit, Chip and SKOAR!_, which had tons of gaming content. 
I loved reading about over-clocking, people installing a custom-built water cooling mechanism for their PCs, 
the rise of the GPUs. Then there was the exciting possibility of PPUs, the revolution brought by both 
_PlayStation 3_ and _XBox 360_. And of course, the insane looking hardware from _Alienware_. Game reviews were fun to read, 
and getting into the lore of games like _Half Life_ was thrilling.

As I got older, and magazines stop becoming a thing, I got more interested in programming and other things tech. 
Until two years back when my wife gifted me a _Nintendo Switch_ and then a year later, I bought the _Steam Deck_. 
The fact that I never played many video games as a child made me experience a lot of things for the first time. 
_Zelda BOTW_ gave me a sense of wonder that I had not felt for a very long time,
and the _Doom (2016 and eternal)_ made me feel like an unstoppable force. _Alien Isolation_ introduced another world of gaming to me altogether 
which I can't wait to delve into again. But the most joy comes from playing games that I had mostly just read
about as a child. Playing _Half Life_ and _Black Mesa_ on the Deck seemed like the right thing to do
and the right way to experience them. The act felt like a homage to Valve. And while the Switch is not being used 
as much as before, I can't wait to play some OG Nintendo titles on it because Nintendo never officially 
existed in India—even now.  

In a way, I am glad that I played a few video games as a child. 
Getting into them now makes technology fun again when otherwise most things in tech seem
to be either reparative or even depressing dystopian.
