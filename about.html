    <p> Hello, I am Kartikey Kushwaha. </p>

    <p> I am an Android Engineer at <a href="https://www.elli.eco/en/home" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer"> Elli</a>  and currently reside in Germany.</p>

    <p> I love reading, learning, running, and creating things that are aesthetically pleasing and delightful to use.
        Currently, I am learning iOS programming, getting better at Jetpack Compose and trying to write regularly.</p>

    <p> You can reach out to me here - hello [at] krtkush [dot] com</p>

    <p><h3>Meta</h3>

    <p>This is a Jekyll website hosted on GitHub Pages and the template
        is <a href = "https://github.com/onepase/Ephesus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesus</a> which I have heavily modified to my liking. <br>
        The modifications to the template are inspired by the
        website <a href = "https://malloc.dog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghettos Of Abu Nawas </a> which I came across on Hacker News.
